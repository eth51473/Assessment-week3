The internet is a giant network of computers,
 meaning that all of these computers are able to share resources and information with one another. These computers used to have to connect to eachother with wires, but now we can do it over wifi as well. Because there are so many computers there are many protocols that have to be followed when sending information to one another. We also now use routers as a way to connect more computers to eachother in a more efficient manner that allows the router to manage the data being sent and ensure that it is sent to the correct location.

 Each computer has its own address called an ip address and any website or link should be stored on a specific computer with a specific ip address.When we click a link, a lot goes on in the background that we don't see. Similar to when we type a websites url into our browser, after we click a link our computer has to find where that link points to or what it's address is. Because ip addresses are just numbers and are difficult to remember, we use something called the Domain Name System (dns) that allows us to connect easy to remember domain names like google, to exact ip addresses. This way when we click a link, we use the dns to locate the ip address of that link and then we are able to find the file that we are tying to navigate to.
